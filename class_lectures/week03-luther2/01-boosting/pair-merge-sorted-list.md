# Merging Sorted Lists

 Write a function that will take as input two sorted lists of length m and n (you can assume they are already sorted) and merges the two lists into a single sorted list (returning the combined sorted list).

 Do not use any pre-written sorting functions as part of your solution!

Input
    [1,3,5,6],
    [2,4,7]

Output
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Input
    [1,2,15],
    [12]

Output
    [1,2,12,15]


Input
    [],
    [1,2]

Output
    [1,2]


Extra Credit:
Optimize! The best solution can run in O(m+n) time.  Then, try it for k lists (input a list of lists)
