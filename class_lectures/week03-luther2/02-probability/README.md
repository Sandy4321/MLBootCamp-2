### Plan for Tuesday, October 3

#### Overview

Let's step away from regression from a bit, as you should have enough of those tools for your Luther projects.  For the next few days we'll talk about Probability and Statistics, starting with a Probability intro today.  We'll also throw in a little extra `sklearn` fun to keep things interesting.
