# Welcome to Week 3: "Regression and Intro to Probability"

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

This week we'll finish up talking about **Regression** techniques for you to use on Project Luther.  Then we'll move on to discussing **Probability** and **Statistics** so we can introduce **Hypothesis Testing** and the important concept of **A/B Testing**.

#### Technical Focus

We're starting this week finishing our discussion of **Tree-Based Regression** models, namely with **Gradient Boosted Trees**.  For the remainder of Project Luther, we'll talk about basic **Probability Theory** so that we can cover **Statistical Hypothesis Testing** and **A/B Testing** as these are important concepts in business for concluding whether or not your work is making an impact.  Lastly, we are looking forward to seeing your presentations on Friday!
