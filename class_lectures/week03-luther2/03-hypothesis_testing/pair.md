## Pair Problem (even more Probability...)

### The Birthday Paradox

Question: How many students must be in a room for it to be more probable than not that 2 (or more) students have the same birthday?

Please come up with solutions using:
1. Analytically: Write down equations for Conditional Probability
2. Computationally: Run a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the numerical solution

### Medical Testing: Am I sick?

Consider the rare disease Paulitis, and the following events surrounding it:
A: Any person in the general population has Paulitis
B: A person tests positive for Paulitis

These events have the following relevant probabilities (~ means "NOT"):
P(A) = 0.0001
P(B|A) = 0.99
P(B|~A) = 0.1

**Question 1:**  
Given that a person tests positive for Paulitis, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?

**Question 2:**  
How many consecutive positive tests would be required for you to conclude that they actually have Paulitis?
