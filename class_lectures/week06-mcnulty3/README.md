# Welcome to Week 6: "Unsupervised Intro and some NLP!"

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

McNulty presentations are on Wednesday, so the first half of the week will just consist of a **Classification Review** and plenty of work time.  At the end of the week we'll be on to [**Project 4: Fletcher**](/projects/04-fletcher).  For that we'll need to discuss **Unsupervised Learning** aka **Clustering** and how you'll get and store your data with **APIs** and **NoSQL**.

#### Technical Focus

Monday is for review of all things classification. Tuesday is for finishing your McNulty projects!  On Wednesday you will present said projects. We will introduce the fourth project, [**Project Fletcher**](/projects/04-fletcher), on Thursday as well as all sorts of **Clustering Algorithms** in our first foray into **Unsupervised Learning**.  For Fletcher you'll be getting your data from **APIs**, so that will be the afternoon topic on Thursday.  Plus, the data must be applicable for an **NLP** project (aka text), so we'll start chatting about that on Friday.  An ideal way to store unstructured text data is in what's called a **NoSQL Database** and we'll explore this paradigm via one particular NoSQL Database, **MongoDB**.
