### Plan for Thursday, October 26

#### Overview

3 projects down everyone, today it's on to the next one!  We'll introduce the 4th project, [**Project Fletcher**](/projects/04-fletcher), which is on **Unsupervised Learning**.  Hence, we'll get our first taste of unsupervised learning with some different **Clustering** algorithms.  Time permitting, we'll talk about **APIs** as that is the preferred method for acquiring your project data this time.
