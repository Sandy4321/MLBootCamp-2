### Plan for Monday, September 25

#### Overview

Good morning friends.  Welcome back.  Hopefully you all relaxed after week 1 and are ready to really kick things into gear, but if you spent all weekend on Benson challenges that's fine too :wink:.

Today we'll introduce Machine Learning which will be a focus throughout the remainder of the course.

In the afternoon we'll introduce **Web Scraping** with **BeautifulSoup** so you can steal all of your favorite company's data...err uh, I mean so you can learn to pull data from pretty much any location on the world's greatest data source, the interwebs.  The motivation for this will be clear when we introduce Luther at the end of the day, which will require these skills.

**Remember:**
* Your **Benson Challenges** are **due today**
* Your **Benson/week 1 blogs** are **due tomorrow**
- Head over to the challenges section and read the **Math Primer** (Challenge 2) when you get a chance.
