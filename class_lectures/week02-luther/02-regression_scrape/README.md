### Plan for Tuesday, September 26

#### Overview

The Pair programming problem will be a primer for Linear Regression, the main topic of today.

The lecture will be on **Linear Regression**, **Overfitting**, and **Regularization**.  These topics will be invaluable in coming up with awesome ideas to rock Project Luther (Stringer).  we will tak a minor detour into **Pickling** objects in Python so that you can save them to disk for later.  Then time-permitting we will cover some more web scraping (for harder tasks) with a different package called Selenium.

**Remember:**
* Your **Benson/week 1 blogs** are **due today**
* Luther ideas via Slack by **Wednesday**
* You need to have your Luther scraping **complete** by **Friday**
