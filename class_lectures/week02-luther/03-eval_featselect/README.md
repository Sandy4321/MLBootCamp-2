### Plan for Wednesday, September 27

#### Overview

Today we're going to talk about ways to estimate generalization error (cross-validation and train/test splits) so that we can evaluate our models.  We'll have more exercises on building different regression models in `sklearn`, feature engineering, and improving on them incrementally.

In the afternoon we'll have an investigation and then you'll be free to continue working on the exercise or to move on to Project Luther or the 2 outstanding challenges.

**Remember:**
* You need to have your Luther scraping **complete** by **Friday**
* Challenges 2-4 are posted [here](/challenges/challenges_questions).  Take a look and check the due dates available [here](/).
  * Each Monday, you should check the root of the repo to see if there are other challenges for you to work on.  They are all posted so you're free to work ahead, but the assigned and due dates are listed so you can do them parallel to their lecture content.
  * Challenges 3-4 are due **Monday 10/2**
