### Plan for Thursday, October 12

#### Overview

For Project McNulty, you need to build a web app with visualizations!  Thus, you'll need to understand a little bit about how the interwebs work.  The next few days will be aimed at just that, and we'll start today by talking about **HTML**, **Javascript**, and some other things.  In the afternoon, we'll show you how to pull **PostgreSQL data into Pandas** with **SQLAlchemy**.
