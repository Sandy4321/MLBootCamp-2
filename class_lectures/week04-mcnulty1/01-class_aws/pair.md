Work with your partner to answer the questions below for each of these regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor. 

Feel free to use the internet as needed. We will randomly call on you to answer questions when we review.

    1) Is it interpretable?
    2) Does it perform feature selection?
    3) How can you adjust the quality of the fit (prevent underfitting and overfitting)?
    4) How does it handle feature interactions?
    5) Is it good with diverse (non-homogenous) sets of features?
    6) Is it scalable with large number of features and data points (in terms of execution time and quality of results)?

Optionally, give a business use case where each algorithm would be most or least appropriate.
