### Plan for Monday, October 9

#### Overview

Today we start your 3rd project, [Project McNulty](/projects/03-mcnulty)!  This will be a **classification** project, so for the next couple weeks the main machine learning topics will be different classification algorithms.  Today we will introduce classification in general with a simple algorithm, **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

McNulty also has components in **SQL**, **cloud servers**, and especially **"Data Products"**, so we will also intermix those topics with the classification algos.  Data Products means we want you to package up your fancy models in a web app (via **Flask**) complete with some snazzy data visualizations using (probably) **D3**!

**Remember**:
* Challenges 5-6 are due **Today**!
* Challenges 7-8 are already out there, due **10/16**

#### Schedule

**9:15 am**: Welcome back! You need an AWS account today; make sure you're signed up. You'll know you are because you can go to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and see a big list of services, with your name and AWS region in the upper right.

**9:30 am**: [Pair Problem](pair.md)

**10:30 am**: [Supervised Learning: Classification and KNN](supervised_classification_knn.pdf)

**11:15 am**: [Another look at cross eval with KNN!](knn_cross_validation.ipynb)

**12:00 pm**: Lunch!

**1:30 pm**: Investigation Presentation: Yanxi

**1:45 pm**: Setting up Cloud (AWS) servers!
* [AWS Prep](aws_0_prep.md)
* [Setting up cloud servers](aws_1_setup_cloud.md) and
* [installing Python packages on AWS](aws_2_installing_pkgs.md)

**2:45 pm**: [Introducing Project McNulty](/projects/03-mcnulty)

**3:00 pm**: McNulty Brainstorming

 * What are your questions?
