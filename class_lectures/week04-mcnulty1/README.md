# Welcome to Week 4: "Classification Algorithms, AWS, SQL, and some Web!"

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Week 4: an incredibly dense week! We'll have to introduce **Classification** and discuss a couple basic algorithms to wet your appetite.  All the while we'll have to make time to try out **AWS**, learn **SQL**, and understand some **Web** concepts to apply toward your 3rd project.

#### Technical Focus

We are going to start off the week with an introduction of [**Project 3: McNulty**](/projects/03-mcnulty). We will then give an introduction to **Classification** as well as the **KNN** algorithm.  We will each launch our very own **Elastic Cloud Computers (EC2)** on **AWS** as well as various installs there including **Postgres SQL**.  This will lead into a discussion of **relational database** design and **SQL**.  We will continue our discussion of classification theory and implementation by covering **Logistic Regression** and some **Classification Evaluation Metrics**.  At the end of the week we'll start talking about **Web Basics** like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**, and applying it toward visualization with **D3**.  Lastly, we will check our understanding of all the topics we have covered so far with a **quiz on Friday**.
