# Welcome to Week 5: "More Classification and Data Products!"

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

In Week 5 we'll wrap up our Classification Series with **Trees**, **Support Vector Machines**, **Neural Networks**, and **Naive Bayes Classification**.  Weaved in, we'll finish up our tour of **Data Products** with **D3** and **Flask**.

#### Technical Focus

As you continue to develop your McNulty masterpieces, you will learn how to work with some amazing tools this week that you can leverage for your projects.  On Monday we will revisit **Trees** but this time in the context of classification, as well as go over quiz results (and open questions) from last week's quiz.  On Tuesday we'll pivot back to **Data Products** with **D3** and wrap things into a **Web Application** with **Flask**.   The rest of the week will get back to more **Classification Algorithms** including **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Neural Networks**, and **Naive Bayes**.
