* What is the derivative of $x^{2}$?
* What is the derivative of log(x)?
* What is the derivative of $e^{x}$?
* z = f(y) & y = g(x) what is $\frac{dz}{dx}$?
* How would you numerically evaluate a gradient? What does the python code look like?
* **Extra**: Try grabbing the Iris Dataset from sklearn and coding Gradient Descent with the Logistic Loss function [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification)
