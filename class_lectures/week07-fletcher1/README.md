# Welcome to Week 7: "Unsupervised learning, Dimensionality Reduction and Topic Modeling"

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

This week you will gain unsupervised learning superpowers through the awesomeness of various clustering methods, Word2Vec, LDA and more.  You learn how to combat the 'Curse of Dimensionality' by using dimensionality reduction techniques as well as learn about some other interesting applications of matrix decomposition.

#### Technical Focus

We will start the week with a intro to Unsupervised Learning as well as your first clustering algorithm, KMeans.
We will learn about some of the issues we face when working data of very large dimensions and how we can leverage dimensionality reduction through PCA and other Matrix Decomposition methods.  You will learn how to extract topics from your text data via LDA and well as how to extract 'semantic meaning' with word embeddings through Word2VEC.  Lastly, we will add a number of new clustering algorithms to your arsenal including: Agglomerative clustering and DBSCAN.
