### Plan for Tuesday, Sep 19

#### Overview

Day 2 is primarily for really diving into [Project Benson](/projects/01-benson) and its associated challenges.  After Pair Programming in the morning Paul will introduce the concept of complexity, important to take into consideration for anything you implement in code.  Then we'll talk about some basic visualization techniques with `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`.  These data visualization skills will come in handy when exploring the nasty data you need to munge through in your Benson projects/challenges.

As emphasized on Day 1, soft skills are important for Benson.  Thus, time permitting we'll walk you through some guidelines for brainstorming that apply to all of your projects, as well as how you should use an iterative approach to tackle all of your data science projects.  In the afternoon, we will walk you through the basics of Git and GitHub that you'll need to use repeatedly to manage content in this class.

**Note on Git and GitHub**: Take a moment to read the [note on git](/resources/git/note_on_git.md) before you get too worked up about it.  In summary, Git and GitHub will play a central role in this class, but we're here to help.  Things will probably go wrong at some point, but don't stress about it, being an absolute Git guru is not essential for this class.

The rest of the day will be yours, to use your time (on either projects or challenges) as you see fit!

**Remember:**
* Project Benson Backstories are due end of day today
* We will review challenge problems 1-3 tomorrow, Wednesday 9/20
* The full challenge set is not due until Monday 9/25

#### Schedule

[A thought for the day](https://twitter.com/sanityinc/status/581079954307305472)

**9:15 am**: Good morning! :coffee:

**9:30 am**: [Pair Problem](pair_alphabets.md)
 * Pairs for today: [('Carl', 'Andre'), ('Trent', 'Sufyan'), ('Mike', 'Jeff'), ('Kenny', 'Kalgi', 'Pradnya'), ('Yanxi', 'Laura'), ('Chuoran', 'Rebekah')]

**10:30 am**: [Intro to Complexity](Introduction_to_complexity.ipynb)

**11:15 am**: [Visualization with Matplotlib, Pandas](intro-to-matplotlib.ipynb)
              [and Seaborn](intro-to-seaborn.ipynb)     

**12:00 pm**: Lunch

**1:30 pm**: *(Optional)* [Iterative Design](Brainstorming_and_Design.ipynb)

**2:00 pm**:  Git et al.:
  - [Git Intro](Github_intro.pdf)
  - [Git Workflow](../../../resources/git)


By the end of the day:

 * Have a problem statement for your Benson group submitted on Slack. Whether based on the original example client email or a variation, this should express the angle your group is working on. Think about how individual group members can all contribute.

## More Resources
 * The [Atlassian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) are a pretty nice way to get up to speed with `git`.
 * [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
 * git [cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
