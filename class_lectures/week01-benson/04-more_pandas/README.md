### Plan for Thursday, Sep 21

#### Overview

Good early morning!  Today we finish Benson.  That is, you should really aim to finish the data crunching aspects of your project today.  If you haven't already laid out and delegated tasks for your group, you need to do that ASAP.  You'll have the entire afternoon to work on this today, and on Friday morning you really should just be preparing your presentations and proposals.

As far as technical content, this morning we'll briefly review possible answers to the first 3 Data Munging Challenges.

 * You have submitted all of your team's project materials (proposal, slides, code) on GitHub.
 * You have submitted your Benson challenges on GitHub.
 * You have a write-up about your analysis of MTA turnstile (and/or other) data on your blog, and there's a link to this write-up on the class [Google sheet](placeholder).



### Additional Resources

 * What if I screw up and commit something that I shouldn't have, like a giant data file or some secret info like a password or API key?
     * GitHub on how to [Remove sensitive data](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/) (note that you may want to skip to the section on the BFG)
 * [Numpy array tip sheet](http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~myers/teaching/ComputationalMethods/python/arrays.html), a little old but still pretty good for current `numpy` versions
