### Plan for Wednesday, Sep 20

<img src="img/hump_day.jpg"/>

#### Overview

For Day 3 of Benson we'll show you some Python and Jupyter fun.  For instance, what's with all those \__xxx methods and variables in Python? What does all the word vomit printed when I get an error mean?  And more, you get the idea.    

If we have time, we'll do a little bit more `pandas` together to help with your Benson exploration, but if not that will be distributed as a resource that we'll cover together tomorrow.

In the afternoon you'll have more time to work on Benson things.  You should make finishing challenges 1-3 your first priority (feel free to collaborate) as I'll distribute solutions this evening.

**Remember:**
* Informal Benson check-ins with Paul/Joe today, you must have your ideas formally defined and approved today, 2 days till presentations!
